For this project, I wanted to bring attention to mask wearing and rhetorically I wanted to show how wearing a mask can only help and will never hurt you.
It is still a work in progress so I may change the images that I use but I wanted to make an image that makes the normal person that is anti-mask think about their decision and change the way the live life in the era of COVID-19.
I have the idea of having minimal text that is very powerful and images that evoke emotional response in the viewer, maybe showing people that are sick or hurt extremely by COVID.
Also, I am still learning how to use GIMP effectively, but my final project will surely reflect my proficiency in GIMP as I am still learning and it is a work in progress.
I wanted to show that anyone can wear a mask and strengthen the idea through my use of the several images. I also used an image from WWII that shows someone wearing a mask
in order to show that this has been needed in certain situations for many many years.
For my very final version, I want to use a few different features in GIMP like the opacity and possibly changing my font for the words and the color of the words.
